## Ways to Greet

In the recent few weeks, while the virus outbreak is causing panic and misinformation across the nations, people in the global community have been super helpful with finding ways to keep humanity alive. One of the ways in which they are doing so is by fining unique approaches to greet one another. 

So I prepared a list which people can populate to show various ways that we can greet each other without physcial contact in order to avoid spread of the virus. 

Hope this helps :)

Note:
This code was also something that I took help from the workbook activities. I followed the guide of the database workbook and backend-workbook challenges and built this design off of the pizza toppings exercise.
